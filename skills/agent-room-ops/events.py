"""room-ops · events — client half of Agent Event Subscription & Delivery (#184).

Three surfaces, all speaking the FIXED #184 contract (the server half is built
separately against the same contract — this code targets the contract, never a
server implementation):

  - subscription management — `events_subscribe` / `events_unsubscribe` /
    `events_subscriptions` ops on the generic `POST {base}/v1/room` envelope
    (one privileged endpoint, many ops — same shape as doc/mention).
  - long-poll pull — `GET {base}/v1/events?cursor=<int>&wait=<sec>`; one
    bounded round per call; timeout = empty `events` + unchanged cursor.
  - SSE push — `GET {base}/v1/events/stream`; each event is `id: <cursor>` +
    `data: <json envelope>` + blank line; `:`-comment lines are keepalives.
    Resume via the `Last-Event-ID` request header (header wins server-side
    over `?cursor=`, so the header is the only resume channel used here).

Delivery is at-least-once. The client's dedup/replay anchor is the CURSOR the
caller persists (stream_with_resume + save_cursor's write-fsync-rename), not
any server-side state — reconnecting with an old cursor replays events, and
that is correct behaviour; consumers dedup on event_id/cursor.

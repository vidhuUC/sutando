"""room-ops · react — add / remove an agent's reaction on a room event.

Native m.reaction add (`react`) + redact (`unreact`) — the Discord auto-react
instant-ack parity (🫡 on receipt, ✅/⚠️ on done/fail). The event is typically
the task's source_message_id. Gateway-only; membership enforced gateway-side.

Emoji convention (owner-finalized): 🫡 = task acknowledged (accepted into the
queue), 👀 = event merely OBSERVED. "received" is a task-ack, so it is 🫡 — 👀
belongs to ambient observation (events_acceptance.OBSERVE_REACTION) and must
not double as the receipt ack, which is the collision this convention retires.
The broker also emits 🫡 server-side at task intake (ag2space-backend#188), so
this client alias agrees with that one glyph everywhere.

"""Task priority taxonomy + readers.

Three-tier enum so writers attach an explicit `priority:` header and consumers
can decide what to process first when more than one task is pending. Keeps the
semantics intentionally coarse — finer-grained scheduling lives in a future
lease-based scheduler; today this is just machine-readable metadata.

Defaults by source (writers emit these; consumers can override per call):
  voice, phone            -> "urgent"   (sub-second response expected)
  chat, context-drop      -> "normal"   (owner foreground)
  discord, telegram, slack (owner-tier)        -> "normal"
  discord, telegram, slack (team/other-tier)   -> "low"
  health-check, sync-memory, sync-workspace, cron -> "low"

Anything not recognized parses as "normal" (fail-open). Order on disk:
"urgent" -> "normal" -> "low" -> unknown -> oldest mtime tiebreak.

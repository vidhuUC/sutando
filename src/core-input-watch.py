"""core-input-watch.py — the core supervisor MONITOR (M1).

The detached bundled core runs Claude Code's interactive TUI with no TTY. Most
first-run gates are pre-seeded so the core never stops on them, but some
interactions inherently need the user (/login) or can't be predicted (a
mid-session permission request, a model/selection prompt, an unknown dialog).
With no TTY the core silently BLOCKS, "alive but stuck".

This is the MONITOR layer of the core supervisor (design: notes/design-core-
supervisor.md). Each tick it writes a single `state/core-supervisor.json` the
desktop app reads for BOTH its status display AND the "Action needed" banner. It
never acts; PREVENT (seeds), AUTO-ANSWER, ESCALATE (the banner), and RECOVER
(restart) are the other layers.

Relationship to runtime-health.py (#2092) — ONE derivation core, no drift.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`runtime-health.py` is the owner-designed coarse health signal the desktop
Console renders as a plain-English status strip: {offline, needs_login, working,
idle, unknown}. This supervisor does NOT re-derive liveness independently — that
would give two tmux/process derivations that drift (the review's `naming_conflict`
on #2100). Instead it CONSUMES `runtime_health.derive()` as its base and REFINES
those 5 coarse states into the 8 supervisor states, adding only what escalation
needs (which gate, the prompt text, can-we-auto-answer). The refinement is a pure
mapping, so the two vocabularies provably agree on "is it running / logged in /
idle / wedged":

    runtime-health health   →   supervisor state
    ---------------------       ----------------
    offline                 →   crashed
    needs_login             →   logged-out        (unless an ACTIVE gate shows, below)
    working                 →   running
    idle                    →   idle-ready
    unknown (status stale)  →   hung
    (any, + gateway down)   →   gateway-down       (gateway probe is bundled-specific)
    (any, + active gate)    →   blocked-known / blocked-human   (net-new: pane classify)

runtime-health.json stays the Console's coarse view (unchanged, its consumers
untouched); core-supervisor.json is the escalation-facing refinement of the same
derivation. Net-new here vs runtime-health = the gate classifier (classify),
the auto-answer decision (auto_answer), and the escalation state machine.

Signal schema (state/core-supervisor.json):
  { "state": "<state>", "detail": "<human string>",
    "prompt": "<pane excerpt if blocked, else null>",
    "kind": "<gate kind if blocked, else null>",
    "session": "sutando-core" }

How this runs (the launch + consumer live in the desktop bundle):
  * On-demand one-shot (in-repo, mirrors runtime-health.py's invocation model):
      core-input-watch.py --socket <sock> --out <ws>/state/core-supervisor.json --once
  * Continuous supervision loop: launched by the Tauri desktop bundle
    (ag2space-cinny-desktop #62) alongside the detached core; the "Action needed"
    banner + login button that CONSUME core-supervisor.json are #64 / cinny #130.

Usage:
  core-input-watch.py --socket <tmux.sock> --session sutando-core \
      --out <workspace>/state/core-supervisor.json [--app-data <dir>] \
      [--interval 3] [--stable 2] [--once]

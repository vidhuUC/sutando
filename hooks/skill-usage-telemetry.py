"""Skill-usage telemetry — PostToolUse[Skill] hook.

Emits ONE anonymous ``feature_used {feature: "skill:<name>"}`` product-telemetry
event every time the core invokes a skill (the `Skill` tool). This is the
chokepoint that broadens feature-usage coverage from the two hand-instrumented
scripts (morning-briefing, daily-insight) to the *entire* skill surface without
touching each skill — the loop already runs dozens of skills (proactive-loop,
people-analysis, context-reconstruct, session-recap, task-orphan-check, …) and
none of them reported until now.

Why a hook, not per-skill calls: skills are markdown + scripts of every shape;
wiring `feature_used()` into each is unmaintainable and misses future skills. A
single PostToolUse matcher on the `Skill` tool captures all of them, for free,
the moment they run.

Privacy: sends ONLY the skill's short categorical name (prefixed ``skill:``).
Never the skill arguments, task content, prompts, or any PII — same contract as
`telemetry.feature_used`. Honors the same opt-out (DO_NOT_TRACK / telemetry-
disabled) because it routes through `telemetry.capture()`, which checks opt-out
on every call.

Fail-OPEN, ALWAYS. Telemetry must never break a tool: any error (bad stdin,
missing telemetry module, network) is swallowed and the hook exits 0 with no
output. A PostToolUse observability hook has no decision to make — it observes.

Registration: ``build-hook-settings.mjs`` registers this repo file's absolute
path under PostToolUse for the ``Skill`` matcher. Repo root is found from this
file's location, or via ``$SUTANDO_REPO_ROOT`` for tests.

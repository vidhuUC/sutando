"""Behavioral test: the pairing seed must NOT clobber a corrupt access.json.

Root cause (2026-07-21): the Discord bridge's pairing branch read access.json
with a bare `try/except` that fell back to an empty-allowFrom default, then
WROTE that default back to disk. So a single transient read glitch on
access.json permanently wiped the real config — the owner was dropped from
`allowFrom`, every sender then got a pairing prompt, and pairing codes leaked
into channels (incl. #dev). The owner was silently de-authorized mid-session.

Fix: `read_access_for_seed(path)` distinguishes the three cases —
  - present + valid  → the parsed dict,
  - genuinely ABSENT → a fresh default (first-run onboarding is fine to seed),
  - present but CORRUPT → None, signalling the caller to bail and NOT overwrite.

This test extracts the pure function's source and exercises it against REAL
temp files (no `import discord`, matching the other bridge tests' convention),
plus a structural guard that the pairing branch actually bails on None instead
of regressing to the destructive bare-except write.

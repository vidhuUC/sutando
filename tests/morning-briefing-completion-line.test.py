"""
Tests for `completion_line` in src/morning-briefing.py.

The script WRITES a result file; delivery is a channel bridge's job and may
never happen — no bridge running, or no channel configured on the host. The
old wording printed "Briefing delivered:" unconditionally, reporting an
outcome the script never observes: a run that reached nobody looked identical
to one that reached the owner.

Observed 2026-07-21 on a host with no channel configured: six proactive
results, oldest 8h old, sat undrained in results/ while every run printed
"delivered".

Covers:
  a) the line names the file that was actually written
  b) it carries the narrative through unchanged
  c) it does NOT claim the briefing was delivered
  d) the early-return (sentinel) path makes no delivery claim either

Run: python3 tests/morning-briefing-completion-line.test.py
Exit code: 0 on pass, 1 on fail.

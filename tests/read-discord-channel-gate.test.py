"""Serving-relative contextNotFrom gate for the agent's OWN channel reads
(src/read_discord_channel.py). Proves the SAME blacklist that gates the bridge
prefetch also gates a direct read — keyed on the SERVING channel, so serving a
private channel can still read it while serving a public channel cannot.

All ids below are FICTITIOUS placeholders (no real channels/guilds). The guild
resolver is stubbed, so no live Discord is needed. Run:

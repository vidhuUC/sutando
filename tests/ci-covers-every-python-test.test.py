"""Every test-looking Python file must actually be executed by CI.

CI discovers Python tests with `find tests -name '*.test.py'`. Anything outside
that root or suffix runs only if ci.yml names it explicitly. A fixed list is
maintenance the next author will not know they owe: a test added under
packages/*/tests/ is silently never run, and reads as coverage anyway.

This guard makes that gap self-detecting instead of silent. It failed to exist
when five suites -- including the transport gate and the src/-vs-package drift
guard -- had never run in CI.

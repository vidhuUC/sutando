"""human_action — sparrow side of the human-action bridge (v1 steps 2+3).

The `human-action-bridge.py` hook (main repo, hooks/) writes durable pending
actions to `<state>/human-actions/ha_*.json` and polls them for a decision.
This module closes the loop over the SHIPPED event channel:

  CardPoster       pending action, no card yet → post a question card into the
                   configured room via the gateway message op (sparrow already
                   holds URL/TOKEN — the hook stays transport-free) and record
                   the returned `card_event_id` as the correlation anchor.
  DecisionHandler  room events from the P0/P1 channel → if one is the OWNER
                   answering a pending action (reaction on the card, a reply
                   `answer ha_x 2`, or a bare option number replying to the
                   card), write the decision into the action file. The polling
                   hook picks it up within its poll interval.

Trust boundary: ONLY the configured owner mxid can resolve an action — anyone
else's reaction/reply is ignored (room activity is ambient; resolution is an
owner capability). No owner configured ⇒ the handler is inert. Terminal action
states are immutable — late or duplicate answers never overwrite a resolution,
and expired actions stay expired (the hook already gave Claude the timeout
deny; honoring a late answer would desync).

Chain routing: `HandlerChain([decisions, taskify])` — the first handler that
CLAIMS an event settles it; unclaimed events flow to the next. Decision events
(the owner's answer) are therefore consumed by the bridge and never counted as
taskify material. The chain preserves the EventConsumer handler contract
(offer -> settled ids, last_path passthrough), so the shipped consumer is
untouched.
